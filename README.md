-Actually in Node js it is not good idea to save the file in just Node server.
-So better to use 3rd party library for storage.
Which could be AWS S3, or Cloudinary and so on...
-So here to do it like that, I used cloudinary, and dotenv and so on...

+Use Cloudinary to save the file in Node JS :

-What is good of using Cloudinary instead of just saving the filecin Node server : 
In PHP or JAVA Okay to save files there But Not in Node JS Better to use 3rd party library.

1.Sign Up or login in Cloudinary :
https://cloudinary.com/

2.NPM INIT :
npm init <initialiser> can be used to set up a new or existing npm package.

3.Create a server :

4.Download Dependency for Parse an incoming file upload :
Formidable npm install formidable

5.Pretend to upload image file

6.Make a configuration for Cloudinary :
npm install cloudinary 

7.Use DotENV for private info :
npm install dotenv

8.upload image w/ Cloudinary
